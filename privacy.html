    <h1>Privacy Policy for Flappy Vertical</h1>
    <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> 4th January 2026</p>

    <p>Thank you for playing Flappy Vertical ("we," "us," or "our"). This Privacy Policy explains how we handle information when you use our mobile application (the "Game").</p>

    <p>Your privacy is important to us. Our Game is designed to be fun, and we aim to be transparent about the data processed.</p>

    <h2>1. Information We Collect and Why</h2>
    <p>To provide and improve the Game, we use third-party services that may collect information.</p>

    <h3>A. Firebase (Google)</h3>
    <p>We use Firebase, a Google service, for essential game functionalities:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Firebase Authentication:</strong> To allow you to create an account (via Google Sign-In or email/password) and save your progress securely. This process involves handling your email address, a user ID, and authentication tokens.</li>
        <li><strong>Cloud Firestore (Firebase):</strong> To store your game data, such as your high score, credits, unlocked items, and friends list. This data is linked to your anonymous or registered user ID.</li>
        <li><strong>Firebase Crashlytics:</strong> To detect and analyze crashes in the Game. This service collects crash-related information, including device state, device type, and operating system, to help us fix bugs and improve stability. It does not collect personally identifiable information.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>B. Google AdMob</h3>
    <p>We use Google AdMob to show advertisements in the Game. AdMob may collect and use data to provide personalized ads. This can include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Device identifiers (like the Advertising ID).</li>
        <li>Location data (if location services are enabled).</li>
        <li>Information about your interactions with ads.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>You can manage your ad preferences in your device's settings (e.g., "Limit Ad Tracking" on iOS or "Opt out of Ads Personalization" on Android).</p>

    <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>To operate and maintain the Game (e.g., saving your score).</li>
        <li>To fix bugs and improve the user experience (via Crashlytics).</li>
        <li>To support the Game financially through advertising (via AdMob).</li>
        <li>To provide social features like leaderboards and friend lists.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Data Sharing</h2>
    <p>We do not manually share your personal data with any third parties, except for the data automatically collected by the services mentioned above (Firebase and AdMob) as part of their standard operation.</p>

    <h2>4. Data Security</h2>
    <p>We take reasonable measures to protect your information. Data stored on Firebase is secured by Google's infrastructure. However, no method of transmission over the internet or electronic storage is 100% secure.</p>

    <h2>5. Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>Our Game is not intended for children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If you believe we have inadvertently collected such information, please contact us so we can promptly remove it.</p>

    <h2>6. Your Rights</h2>
    <p>Depending on your location (e.g., if you are in the European Union), you may have rights regarding your personal data, such as the right to access, correct, or delete your data. Our Game provides an in-app feature to delete your account, which will erase your associated data from our primary database.</p>

    <h2>7. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy in the Game or on our website. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.</p>

    <h2>8. Contact Us</h2>
    <p>If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, please contact us via the in-game support feature or at: <a href="mailto:contact.acgames@gmail.com">contact.acgames@gmail.com</a></p>
